# Boilerexams Frontend Application Project

## The chosen solution to my take-home assignment: Problem 4- creating a course page

### Home page

The image above is a screenshot of the home page of the chosen course (CS 180- this course isn't available on 
boilerexams yet so most of the content in it is mainly just dummy content).
Clicking on anything in the main menu for now just leads to the actual pages on the actual boilerexams site. For instance, 
clicking on "About" in the main menu just leads to the "About" page of the actual boilerexams site. However, clicking on
"Home" just leads you back to this home page of the course.
Then you just have a card displaying the course name, and three buttons, whose functionalities we'll be exploring further
down this README.

This page is supposed to be an area that centralizes the storage of all the notes used in class by professors and TAs, to 
revise for the respective exams.
Below the name card are a series of sliders named "Exam 1", "Exam 2" and "Exam 3", and a series of buttons in the slider 
named after several topics in the CS 180 syllabus. For now, only Exam 1 Topic 1 is clickable and leads to a page when clicked.
The other buttons exist only for display purposes.

The above images is what clicking on the Exam 1 Topic 1 directs the user to. It essentially contains a power-point viewer to
a fake presentation, but should be a container for actual power-point notes to the actual topic. The back button at the bottom
brings you back to the Exam Syllabus review page to explore other topics.
