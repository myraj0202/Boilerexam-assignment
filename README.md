# Boilerexams Frontend Application Project

## The chosen solution to my take-home assignment: Problem 4- creating a course page

### Home page

The image above is a screenshot of the home page of the chosen course (CS 180- this course isn't available on 
boilerexams yet so most of the content in it is mainly just dummy content).
Clicking on anything in the main menu for now just leads to the actual pages on the actual boilerexams site. For instance, 
clicking on "About" in the main menu just leads to the "About" page of the actual boilerexams site. However, clicking on
"Home" just leads you back to this home page of the course.
Then you just have a card displaying the course name, and three buttons, whose functionalities we'll be exploring further
down this README.
